    a seamless platform where users will feel safe to use, and no imposition of registeration to browse products and add to cart, users will have to register an acc to place orders.

    To have an ecommerce website where all sort of users can browse through the site and it products collection without imposition to firsts register an account or necessarily having an account registered with the brand, also, to automatically sync all data stored locally during the unregistered phase of a user to a remote collection which would be created when user finally registers an account. A user could even be registered, but probably signed out while browsing the site, but once signed in would be asked permission if they would like to sync the local datas with the remote ones.
